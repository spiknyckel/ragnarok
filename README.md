# Ragnarök
*basically yeets yggdrasil*
## How to use
### Server
Set up a self hosted authentication system on your system, see [recommended examples](#recommended-self-hosted-auth-systems), and expose the `/session/minecraft/join` path to the internet.

### Client
This mod requires the fabric mod loader & the fabric API mod.

When you have launched the game with this mod you should be presented with a **Ragnarök** button on your main screen, if you press it you can enter your IGN, an auth token your server owner should have provided you with as well as an auth server field.
If you enter all of these you are all good! Now you can join without authenticating with mojang :)

**WARNING**: You still need to type in the username of a real account, since you are required to have a real UUID to join.
